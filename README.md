# ELK Stack Provisioning and Configuration on Google Cloud Platform

### Overview

This project is an infrastructure as code solution that leverages Terraform and Ansible to automate the provisioning and configuration of an ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). An ELK stack is a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution used for log aggregation, analysis, and visualization. With this project, you can quickly deploy and manage an ELK stack in your GCP environment to allow you to monitor and troubleshoot application and system logs. The goal is to make this easy to deploy while keeping the deployment scalable and secure by providing clear documentation.
