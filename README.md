# ELK Stack Provisioning and Configuration on Google Cloud Platform

### Overview

This project is an infrastructure as code solution that leverages Terraform and Ansible to automate the provisioning and configuration of an ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
